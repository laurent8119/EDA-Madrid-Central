In 2018, Madrid Central was implemented with the objective of limiting vehicle traffic and improving the air quality in the center of Madrid. We are going to find out if this measure has had an impact on the NO2 pollution in the center.

This project has been carried out at The Bridge Data Science Bootcamp in July 2021. At that time, the World Health Organization guideline was set to 40 Âµg/m3(annual mean) but it has recently been modified to 30.
